"Data Scientist","Washington","World Bank Group","Job #: req6482Organization: World BankSector: Poverty ReductionGrade: GFTerm Duration: 3 years 0 monthsRecruitment Type: International RecruitmentLocation: Washington, DC,United StatesRequired Language(s): EnglishPreferred Language(s):Closing Date: 3/17/2020 (MM/DD/YYYY) at 11:59pm UTCDescriptionDo you want to build a career that is truly worthwhile? Working at the World Bank Group provides a unique opportunity for you to help our clients solve their greatest development challenges. The World Bank Group is one of the largest sources of funding and knowledge for developing countries; a unique global partnership of five institutions dedicated to ending extreme poverty, increasing shared prosperity and promoting sustainable development. With 189 member countries and more than 120 offices worldwide, we work with public and private sector partners, investing in groundbreaking projects and using data, research, and technology to develop solutions to the most urgent global challenges. For more information, visit www.worldbank.orgPoverty and Equity Global PracticeThe Poverty and Equity GP, part of the EFI Cluster of Global Practices, plays three key –leading and supportive– roles: sectoral integrator at country level; generator of knowledge and dialogue; and operational solutions supporter. The country-level work of the Poverty and Equity global practice typically falls under one or more of the following three streams:1) Laying the foundations for evidence-based policy by strengthening data on household welfare: this is the foundational work, mostly delivered through TA and occasionally through statistical capacity-building investment operations, to support the design and implementation of household surveys, provide advice on best-practice methodologies for estimating household welfare, poverty, and shared prosperity, and build capacity and strengthen country systems for collecting data on and monitoring household welfare.2) Defining the agenda through integrative analysis and dialogue: this stream of work has focused on using the household-level data, wherever available, to undertake integrative analyses to inform the policy dialogue and advance the poverty reduction and shared prosperity agenda and priorities at the regional, national and occasionally sub-national levels.3) Delivering operational solutions: this stream of work focuses on collaborating with internal and external partners to translate the upstream analytics into concrete implementable measures and support the implementation of particular interventions aimed at reducing poverty. This includes supporting the preparation of Systematic Country Diagnostics and Country Partnership Frameworks, as well as the analysis of poverty and social impacts of Bank operations.The development and flow of global knowledge within the practice is facilitated through four cross-cutting global solution areas, each of which is led by a thematic Lead Economist. These are: (i) Poverty monitoring and statistical capacity building, (ii) Markets and institutions for poverty reduction and shared prosperity, (iii) Fiscal and social policy for poverty reduction and shared prosperity, and (iv) Resilience to shocks and sustainability of poverty reduction and shared prosperity.Equity Policy LabEmbedded in the Poverty and Equity Global Practice, the Equity Policy Lab is a team of data scientists and economists tasked with providing just-in-time assistance to teams working on the distributional impact of policy reforms. The objective is to increase the likelihood that the Bank’s analytical and operational work regularly considers the distributional impact of interventions by providing the appropriate just-in-time expertise.The Equity Policy Lab works with the Practice’s Global Solutions Groups to develop tools and solutions that can be used across teams. It ensures that these new tools and approaches are disseminated throughout the practice and across the Bank. The Lab also provides a space to improve existing models, pilot new methods and approaches that can support teams and clients in answering important policy design questions.The Equity Lab program is guided by the following principles:1. Addressing World Bank Group’s commitment to assess the poverty and social impact of policy reforms through just-in-time assistance and tool development. The Equity Policy Lab enables teams to comply with the Bank’s corporate commitment to assess the potential distributional impact of policies in the context of its policy development lending by developing tools and providing an evidence base for its technical assistance and policy advice. This work includes development of ex-ante micro-simulation models, as well as diagnostic tools that can be used to guide projects and programs.2. Introducing innovations and technologies in the distributional analysis of reforms to amplify the impact of the WBG’s thought leadership in evidence-based analysis of the distributional impact of policy reforms.3. Promoting cross-sectoral collaboration and learning by embedding in country teams within Poverty GP and engaging with colleagues in other Global Practices, including the macro-fiscal, social protection, education and health Global Practices.Duties and AccountabilitiesThe selected candidate will be based in Washington, DC. The Practice is seeking to recruit an economist or data scientist with strong quantitative methods and advanced programing skills, including working experience in micro-econometric analysis and statistical techniques.

Build partnerships with other groups in the WB, including Development Economics (DEC) teams and other Global Practices (GPs) on poverty, shared-prosperity and equity monitoring issues and applications using recent technologies and methods;iv. Disseminate knowledge gained across country and regional teams in the practice, increasing the use of web-based visualizations on these indicators to tell clear stories;v. Participate in activities and exchange information with other World Bank teams working on similar issues across sectors and Global Solution Groups.Like all members of the Poverty global practice, the economist/data scientist will also be expected to contribute to the global knowledge base of the practice.Selection Criteria1) A Master’s or PhD degree in Economics, Statistics or Computer Science or a closely related field, with a minimum of five years’ relevant experience;2) Technical and Quantitative Skills as an Applied Development Microeconomist - Has experience in microeconometrics and statistical modeling – working with household surveys & performing complex econometric analysis;3) Experience building or working with micro-simulation models to assess the distributional impact of alternative policy reforms.

"Associate Data Scientist","Austin","Levelset","Each month over 500,000 contractors and suppliers connect on Levelset's cloud-based platform to make payment processes stress-free. Users easily exchange payment documents like lien waivers, pay applications, and preliminary notices, they see a complete picture of who is on their job, and are empowered with the resources and knowledge they need to be confident in payment. The results are faster payments and fewer surprises.All of this activity generates millions of entities, records, attribution, and entity relationships. We use this data to create insights about the payment activity of projects and contractors, which helps our users get paid. That's where you come in.You'll be Levelset's first Data Scientist and have the opportunity to influence how we expand our data science use cases across the business and products. You will need to be a ""data utility player"" and be prepared to be able to move data around, analyze opportunities, select the tools and build the infrastructure to support data science, and use our data to innovate our product and advance our purpose. The work you do and models you build will have a direct impact on our users.Types of projects you'll be working on:Text Analysis and Entity RecognitionWe send thousands of documents and ingest thousands more from external sources. This data is messy, sometimes unstructured, and we need to be smarter about how we correlate company entities. How can we tell if two companies with similar names are the same or different?We are collecting thousands of reviews from our users to capture feedback on different contractors on things like payment timeliness, communication practices, etc… How can we summarize the overall sentiment of reviews for a specific contractor and what are the common pros / cons?Advanced Analytics and Data DiscoveryWe have a lot of data on the payment history of contractors. How can we rate the payment risk of a contractor and share that information with users in a helpful, digestible way?A large commercial construction project can last many years and include hundreds of contractors. Or a single address can have multiple projects over the years with different contractors. Or a property, like an office building, can have different distinct projects going on at one time. How can we tell the difference?Data Modeling and HeuristicsA user is on a project that we know other subcontractors are experiencing slow payment on. What other documents should we recommend the user do to ensure they get paid?Most of the construction industry is based on working relationships and prior work history. What relationships and other parties can we infer that are working on the project based on the existing connections from other projects we see in our graph?Skills you'll need:1-3 years of experience working with Machine Learning, Optimization, Neural Networks and/or Artificial IntelligenceA broad understanding of data science techniques and a willingness to ""go deep"" and learn more about a specific topic as it relates to our opportunities.Data cleansing experience using various utilities and programming techniquesText analytics, natural language processing, and entity recognition/extraction to turn documents into informationData processing / ETL to prep and clean data for analysis and production pipelines.R / Python / SQL / Cypher.You'll be helping us build our DS stack out, but familiarity with the tools we have in place will help, including: MySQL, Redshift/Postgres, Neo4j, Kafka, RabbitMQ, and the AWS stack.Why Levelset?Levelset is one of the South's fastest-growing tech companies with 100% growth year over year.

It’s also a good idea to know the standard suite of analytical tools - SQL, R/Python, some sort of data visualization tool - but more importantly you must know how to learn tools quickly. We also often find that having a bit of a software engineering mindset is valued too - much like good software solutions, good analytical solutions are scalable and repeatable as this is what allows us to solve a problem once and go tackle the next one. Last, knowing that in most cases done is better than perfect is important - getting the current problem right to the sixth decimal place is almost always less impactful than getting to the next problem.","","SQL,R,Python",NA
